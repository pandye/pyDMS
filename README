Welcome in pyDMS. This is a simple Django Document Management System.

This need django 1.4 and sqlite3 db to make it run.

This system include following features-
1. Only registered user can access the system.
2. User can upload any attachment.
3. User can download those attachment.
4. User can delete those attachment.

Make the following changes to run this project-
1.In pyDMS/settings.py, under DATABASE name put your absolute database path.
2.In pyDMS/settings.py, change MEDIA_ROOT
3. In pyDMS/settings.py, change TEMPLATE_DIR
4. In DMS/views.py, under downloadPage module, change filename.
After that run "manage.py reset DMS".
And then run syncdb.
Thats it!

If you found any problem, feel free to ask me.
